# 🌊 Flood Relief Response System

A lightweight USSD-based platform designed to connect flood victims with emergency services such as transportation, shelter, and food assistance. The system allows affected individuals to quickly request help using any mobile device (no internet required), while NGOs, volunteers, and government agencies can view, verify, and respond to requests in real time.

## Features:

📱 USSD Access: victims request shelter, food, or transport via simple menu prompts.

✔️ Request Routing: connects needs to available relief providers (NGOs, volunteers, MDAs).

🌍 Location Integration: captures basic location info to prioritize urgent cases.

🔒 Security Measures: prevents spam, fake requests, and data misuse.

🚑 Scalable Design: easily adaptable to other disaster response scenarios.

This project aims to deliver fast, accessible, and life-saving assistance for vulnerable communities during floods and other emergencies.

## 🌍 The Problem

When disasters like floods hit communities in Nigeria, people are often stranded with limited communication options. While smartphones and internet may be unavailable, most people still have basic phones capable of SMS and USSD. This creates a critical gap in emergency response - how do we connect victims to available shelter, food, and transport when traditional communication channels fail?

## 💡 Our Solution

A USSD-based emergency response system that works on any mobile phone, even without internet connectivity. Users simply dial `*384*CHANNEL#` (where CHANNEL is your Africa's Talking channel number) and get instant access to:

- 🏠 **Emergency Shelter** - Find available accommodation
- 🍽️ **Food Distribution** - Locate food centers and kitchens  
- 🚗 **Transport Services** - Connect to evacuation and medical transport

## 🔧 How It Works

### For Disaster Victims:
1. **Dial `*384*CHANNEL#`** on any mobile phone (CHANNEL = your Africa's Talking channel number)
2. **Select service type** (1=Shelter, 2=Food, 3=Transport)
3. **Enter location** (e.g., "Lokoja")
4. **Get matched** with nearest available resources
5. **Receive SMS confirmation** with contact details

### For Service Providers:
1. **Register resources** through web dashboard
2. **Update availability** in real-time
3. **Receive SMS alerts** when matched with requests
4. **Coordinate response** directly with victims

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
📱 Basic Phone (USSD) → 📡 Telecom Gateway → 🖥️ Flask Backend → 🗄️ Database
                                                     ↓
📱 SMS Notifications ← 📡 SMS Gateway ← 🔄 Matching Engine ← 📊 Admin Dashboard
```

### Core Components:

- **USSD Service**: Handles menu navigation and user sessions
- **Matching Engine**: Location-based resource allocation algorithm
- **SMS Service**: Confirmation and alert notifications
- **Admin Dashboard**: Resource management interface
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for integrations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask and dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hackathon

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

The system will start on `http://localhost:8080`

## ⚙️ Africa's Talking Configuration

### Step 1: Get Your Channel Number
1. Login to your Africa's Talking dashboard
2. Go to **USSD** → **Create Channel**
3. Select service code `*384#`
4. Note down the **Channel number** provided (e.g., 17925, 46331, etc.)

### Step 2: Configure Your Application
Edit your `.env` file and update these values:

```bash
# Africa's Talking Configuration
AT_USERNAME=your_username_here           # Your Africa's Talking username
AT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here            # Your Africa's Talking API key
USSD_SERVICE_CODE=*384#                 # Keep this as *384#
USSD_CHANNEL=YOUR_CHANNEL_NUMBER_HERE   # ← Put your channel number here (e.g., 17925)
```

**Example Configuration**:
```bash
AT_USERNAME=sandbox
AT_API_KEY=abcd1234567890
USSD_SERVICE_CODE=*384#
USSD_CHANNEL=17925                      # Your actual channel number
```

**Result**: Users will dial `*384*17925#` to access the emergency system

### Step 3: Set Callback URL
1. Run your application: `python app.py`
2. Expose it using ngrok: `ngrok http 8080`
3. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
4. In Africa's Talking dashboard, set **Callback URL** to: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/ussd/callback`

### Step 4: Test Your Service
- Dial `*384*YOUR_CHANNEL#` from any mobile phone
- You should see the emergency response menu

### 🔧 Configuration Troubleshooting

**Q: Where exactly do I put my channel number?**
A: In the `.env` file, update the line:
```bash
USSD_CHANNEL=17925  # Replace 17925 with your actual channel number
```

**Q: What's my callback URL?**
A: After running `python app.py` and `ngrok http 8080`, your callback URL will be:
```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/ussd/callback
```
Copy this exact URL to Africa's Talking dashboard.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: Check your application logs when someone dials the USSD code. You should see:
```
INFO in routes: USSD request: +234801234567 -
```

**Q: What if I get "Service not available"?**
A: Check that:
1. Your callback URL is correctly set in Africa's Talking
2. Your ngrok tunnel is active
3. Your application is running on port 8080
4. Your channel number matches what's in Africa's Talking dashboard

### Testing the USSD Flow

```bash
# Run the demo script
python demo.py

# Or test manually
python test_ussd.py
